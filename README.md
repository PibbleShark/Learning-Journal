 Learning Journal built with Flask
 
 The learning journal allows you to create entries based on knowledge you have learned.
 
 You can create tags that will help you organize your journal entries.  Entries will become automatically 
 tagged if the tag name is in the "what I learned" section of the entry.  
 
 Entries can be viewed in a list or in a detail form.  If a tag is clicked on, you can see all the entries
 that also have that tag.  
 
 Tags can be deleted on the view by tag page
 
 Entries can be deleted and edited in their detailed view pages.  
 
 The system does not allow for duplicate tags, entry titles or tag associations.
